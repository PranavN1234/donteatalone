This is an idea for an application that won me the NYU hackathon in 2022. The idea of the project is to create an interactive application where people can meet other people with similar cuisine interests to eat out during lunch times. The application was made using C# and AngularJs. 
The project includes a variety of features such as live messaging, presence hub to see when other members are online and rotating photos. Here are some of the photos of the working applicaiton. 

1) The profile page with drag and drop photo addition

2) The home page where you can see other members
